# What is Facial Emotion Recognition?
Facial emotion recognition is the process of detecting human emotions from facial expressions. The human brain recognizes emotions automatically, and software has now been developed that canrecognize emotions as well. This technology is becoming more accurate all the time, and will eventually be able to read emotions as well as our brains do.
AI can detect emotions by learning what each facial expression means and applying that knowledge to the new information presented to it. Emotional artificial intelligence, or emotion AI, is a technology.
that is capable of reading, imitating, interpreting, and responding to human facial expressions and emotions.
# What is the use of emotion detection and recognition?
Emotion recognition is the process of identifying human emotion. People vary widely in their accuracy at recognizing the emotions of others. Use of technology to help people
with emotion recognition is a relatively nascent research area. Generally, the technology works best if it uses multiple modalities in context.
# Why is facial emotion recognition important?
Facial expression recognition or computer-based facial expression recognition system is important because of its ability to mimic human coding skills. Facial expressions and
other gestures convey nonverbal communication cues that play an important role in interpersonal relations.
# Why do we need emotion detection?
Human emotion recognition plays an important role in the interpersonal relationship. ... Emotions are reflected from speech, hand and gestures of the body and through facial
expressions. Hence extracting and understanding of emotion has a high importance of the interaction between human and machine communication.
# How does facial expression recognition work?
Facial expression recognition system is a computer-based technology and therefore, it uses algorithms to instantaneously detect faces, code facial expressions, and recognize emotional states. 
It does this by analyzing faces in images or video through computer powered cameras embedded in laptops, mobile phones, and digital signage systems, or cameras,
 that are mounted onto computer screens. Facial analysis through computer powered cameras generally follows three steps:
 # Face Detection
 
 # Face Landmark Detection
 # Facial Expression and Emotion Classification
 # Which technology is used facial expression and facial detection?
 Facial expression recognition software is a technology which uses biometric markers to detect emotions in human faces.
 
 # Which algorithm is used for face detection?
 Eigenface-Based:- Eigenface based algorithm used for Face Recognition, and it is a method for efficiently representing faces using Principal Component Analysis
